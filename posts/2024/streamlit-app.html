                <h2>Joining the Headstarter Fellowship</h2>
                <p>This summer, I got accepted into the Headstarter AI SWE Fellowship, a New York-based program that was
                    a game-changer for me, even though I’m based in Pakistan. The time difference meant late-night
                    meetings and conferences, but it was worth it. I connected with amazing teammates from other
                    universities, learned a ton about AI and web development, and built some cool projects. One of my
                    favorites was the AI Roadmap Generator, a Streamlit app we created as a team.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="streamlit-app">
                <h2>Building the AI Roadmap Generator</h2>
                <p>The AI Roadmap Generator (<a href="https://ai-roadmap-generator.streamlit.app/">try it here</a>) is a
                    web app that uses Google’s Gemma2-9b open-source model to generate personalized AI learning
                    roadmaps. We integrated Firebase for user authentication and data storage, all built with Streamlit
                    for a quick and clean frontend. Streamlit made it so easy to turn my Python skills into a functional
                    web app without diving too deep into complex web dev.</p>
                <p>Here’s a snippet of how we set up the basic Streamlit interface:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <button class="copy-btn">Copy</button>
                    <pre class="language-python" data-lang="Python"><code>
import streamlit as st

st.title("AI Roadmap Generator")
st.write("Generate a personalized AI learning roadmap with Gemma2-9b!")
user_input = st.text_input("Enter your AI learning goals:")
if st.button("Generate Roadmap"):
    # Placeholder for Gemma2-9b model integration
    st.write("Your roadmap is being generated...")
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
                <p>This code sets up a simple interface where users input their goals, and the app (with backend logic)
                    generates a roadmap. The real magic happens with the Gemma2-9b model and Firebase, but Streamlit’s
                    simplicity let us focus on functionality over frontend fuss.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="challenges">
                <h2>Last-Minute Bugs and Fixes</h2>
                <p>Building the app wasn’t all smooth sailing. We hit a nasty bug with Firebase authentication where
                    sessions weren’t persisting across page refreshes. After hours of debugging, we found a
                    misconfigured Firebase SDK call. Another headache was the Gemma2-9b model’s response time, it was
                    sluggish on initial loads. We optimized the backend to cache common queries, which sped things up.
                    These late-night fixes taught me how critical testing and iteration are in real-world projects.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="teamwork">
                <h2>Teamwork and Deployment</h2>
                <p>I worked with an awesome team, and I have to shout out Awwab, who handled the deployment like a pro.
                    We met through the fellowship and collaborated. Awwab set up the Streamlit app on
                    their hosting platform, ensuring it was live at <a
                        href="https://ai-roadmap-generator.streamlit.app/">ai-roadmap-generator.streamlit.app</a>. The
                    teamwork aspect of the fellowship pairing with folks from different unis—was a highlight and showed
                    me how diverse skill sets come together in software engineering.</p>

                <h2>Other Fellowship Projects</h2>
                <p>The Headstarter Fellowship had us cranking out projects weekly. Here’s a rundown of what I worked on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Week 1: Personal Portfolio Website</strong> – Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                        SvelteKit, hosted on Firebase. Included sections for About, Skills, Projects, and a Contact
                        panel. (I alraedy had this one. Lol! That's why you are reading this post)</li>

                            href="https://github.com/MuhammadTahaNasir/facebook-support-chatbot"> Facebook Support
                            Ai-Chatbot</a>)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Week 4: AI Flashcards with Stripe</strong> – A flashcard app with OpenAI-generated cards
                        and Stripe payments, built with React and Node.js.</li>
                    <li><strong>Week 5: AI “Rate My Professor” App</strong> – Used RAG and vector search with OpenAI for
                        course feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weeks 6–7: AI Health App</strong> – Our team’s final project, a capstone AI health app
                        focused on growth and user acquisition. Details coming soon!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These projects pushed my coding and collaboration skills to the next level. Check out my portfolio
                    for more details!</p>
            </section>
            <section id="whats-next">
                <h2>What’s Next</h2>
                <p>The fellowship was intense but rewarding. I’m hooked on Streamlit for quick prototyping and plan to
                    explore more AI-driven web apps. The AI Health App from our final project is something I’m excited
                    to polish and share soon. I’ll keep posting about my progress, so stay tuned for more!</p>
