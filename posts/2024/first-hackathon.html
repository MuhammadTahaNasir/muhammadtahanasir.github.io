                <h2>AWS Cloud Club Beginnings</h2>
                <p>Assalam o Alaikum, fam! April 2024 was a whirlwind. Started with our uni’s AWS Cloud Club launch, and
                    man, it was like stepping into a new world. They were talking about cloud stuff like EC2, S3, Lambda
                    and I was just trying to keep my head above water. Scribbled notes like I was back in school, but
                    the vibe was so cool, everyone hyped about building projects. I found some free AWS tutorials online
                    at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">aws site</a>, and they were a lifesaver for understanding the
                    basics. Got me thinking, “Okay, time to make something!”</p>

            <section id="hackathon">
                <h2>My First Hackathon at GIKI</h2>
                <p>On 19 April, I went for my first hackathon at GIKI, called Micathon. Was I nervous? Oh, yeah. But I
                    thought, “Let’s just do this.” It was a mess of ideas my team was throwing out plans, coding like
                    crazy, and trying not to break everything. We used some AWS stuff I learned from the club. Our
                    project didn’t win (it was a bit of a disaster, lol), but I learned so much about AI-related ideas.
                    Already looking forward to the next one. Pro tip: AWS’s free training on their site helped me prep
                    for this.</p>

            <section id="fpsc">
                <h2>FPSC Mock and Coding Prep</h2>
                <p>Then, on 22 April, our uni had a mock for FPSC, a competitive programming contest. I’m not some
                    coding wizard, but I gave it a shot. DOM Judge was the platform, and it was intense solving problems
                    with a clock ticking felt like a race. My code kept failing, but I picked up some algorithm tricks.
                    Codeforces has some great practice problems if you’re into this stuff. Got advice from seniors to
                    stay calm next time, and I’m ready to improve.</p>

            <section id="summer">
                <h2>Semester Wrap and Summer Plans</h2>
                <p>Second semester’s almost over, and finals are coming in May. After that, it’s summer break, and I’m
                    pumped. Planning to keep coding, maybe fix that hackathon project, and write more about my tech
                    journey. I’ve got some goals in mind, and I’ll share them in my next posts. April was wild, but it’s
                    got me ready for more. For now, I’m just grinding, learning, and keeping it real.</p>
