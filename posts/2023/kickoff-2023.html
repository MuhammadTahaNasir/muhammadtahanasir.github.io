                <h2>A New Year, New Chaos</h2>
                <p>Yo, it’s February 2023, and I’m kicking off my blog for the year! Last year was wild, messing with
                    Python, Java, and getting humbled by LeetCode. Now, I’m staring down a big summer: university
                    entrance tests. The goal’s a solid CS program at a good uni, but real talk, I’m juggling college
                    assignments, self-learning, and test prep like a circus clown. Here’s how I’m holding it together.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="ai-inspiration">
                <h2>AI and ChatGPT’s Spell</h2>
                <p>AI’s got me hooked, and it’s not just me chasing hype. Last year, I was all about self-driving cars
                    and chatbots, but when ChatGPT showed up in November, it was a game-changer. I’d ask it to fix my
                    Python code or explain a tricky LeetCode problem, and it’d break it down like a friend who’s got all
                    the time in the world. It even helped me brainstorm a college project on recommendation systems. AI
                    went from cool idea to something I could actually work with.</p>
                <p>This year, I’m playing with Scikit-learn to build simple ML models. ChatGPT’s knack for explaining
                    tough stuff makes AI feel like a puzzle I can solve, one script at a time.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="python-love">
                <h2>Python: My Ride-or-Die</h2>
                <p>Python’s my go-to, hands down. It’s clean, quick, and perfect for AI stuff. Libraries like NumPy,
                    Pandas, and Scikit-learn let me mess with data and ML without losing my mind over syntax like I did
                    with Java. Last month, I made a small script to predict my study hours for test prep using Pandas.
                    Felt like I was hacking my own life.</p>
                <p>Here’s a bit of that script, just for kicks:</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre>
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Predicting study hours based on past data
data = {'Day': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'Hours': [2, 3, 2.5, 4]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
X = df[['Day']]
y = df['Hours']
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
print(f"Predicted hours for Day 5: {model.predict([[5]])[0]:.2f}")
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>Python’s my way into AI. It’s where I test ideas, build models, and keep learning without wanting to
                    throw my laptop out the window.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="balancing-act">
                <h2>Balancing Uni Prep, College, and Coding</h2>
                <p>Real talk: juggling college, self-learning, and uni test prep is like playing Tetris on nightmare
                    mode. College exams eat my time, LeetCode still makes me question my life choices, and entrance test
                    books are thicker than my patience. But I’m managing. Mornings are for test prep, mostly math and
                    logic problems. Afternoons go to college assignments, and nights are for coding or AI stuff.</p>
                <p>Self-learning keeps me going. FreeCodeCamp and Tech With Tim help me stay sharp with Python, while
                    ChatGPT’s there to fix my code or explain concepts. Consistency’s tough, but I’m aiming for one
                    LeetCode problem a day. Slow progress is still progress, right?</p>
            </section>
            <section id="whats-next">
                <h2>What’s Next for 2023</h2>
                <p>2023’s gonna be big. By summer, I’ll wrap up my coding classes and finish my course, which is a huge
                    milestone. I’m aiming for a uni that’ll let me go deeper into CS and AI. I want to play around with
                    NLP, maybe build a small chatbot of my own. Once I’m in uni, I’ll be dealing with lectures and side
                    projects, so I’ll share how I manage that chaos. I’m also starting to think about the bigger stuff,
                    like how to make sure AI is used right. I’ll keep blogging about my projects, my mess-ups, and all
                    the questions AI’s got me asking. My goal? Stay steady, keep learning, and maybe get some sleep.</p>
                <p>To anyone else chasing their tech dreams: you don’t need to have it all sorted. One line of code, one
                    problem solved, that’s enough to keep going. Keep at it, bro.</p>
