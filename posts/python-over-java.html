                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>It’s May 2022, and I enrolled in separate courses for Python and Java, and honestly, I was pretty
                    clueless about which one I’d like more. Then Sir Zia, my teacher, showed me how Python could make
                    coding feel so much easier. That’s when I started leaning toward Python over Java. This post is
                    about why Python clicked for me and how Sir Zia helped spark my interest.</p>

                <h2>Why Python Felt Right for Me</h2>
                <p>Python feels so much easier to work with. The code is clean, and I can write something that works
                    without getting stuck on complicated rules. Libraries like Pandas and NumPy make things like data
                    analysis or math super simple, which I couldn’t do as easily in Java. Python just lets me focus on
                    solving problems instead of wrestling with the language itself.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy to read: Python’s code looks almost like English, which makes it less confusing.</li>
                    <li>Powerful libraries: Pandas and NumPy helped me handle data and calculations quickly.</li>
                    <li>Quick to start: I could build small projects faster than I could in Java.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="my-experience">
                <h2>Learning Python & Java Side-by-Side</h2>
                <p>At the institute, I was taking Java and Python courses side by side. Java was fine, but it felt like
                    a lot of work. I had to write so much code just to do simple stuff, like setting up a program.
                    Python was way different, Sir Zia showed us how a few lines could do so much. For example, printing
                    in Python is just <code>print("Hello")</code>, while Java needs a whole class and main method. That
                    simplicity made me like Python more.</p>
                <p>Zia Sir’s classes were a big reason I got into Python. He’d explain things in a way that made coding
                    feel doable, and he’d show us cool examples, like using Python to sort data or make small scripts.
                    Java classes were okay, but the resources online for Java felt too technical for me right now.
                    Python
                    had tons of beginner-friendly tutorials, which Zia Sir pointed us to, and that helped me learn
                    faster.</p>

                <h2>Early Projects with Python</h2>
                <p>I started messing around with Python for small projects, and that’s when I really got hooked. My
                    first project was a simple script to track my study hours using Pandas. It wasn’t fancy, but seeing
                    it work felt great. Then I used NumPy to mess around with some math problems for a college
                    assignment, and it was so much faster than doing it by hand or in Java. These little projects showed
                    me how Python lets you prototype ideas quickly without getting bogged down.</p>
                <p>In Java, I tried similar projects, but they took longer to set up. Python let me test ideas and see
                    results fast, which kept me motivated to keep coding.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="what-i-learned">
                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Python is great for beginners because it’s simple and gets you coding faster.</li>
                    <li>Libraries like Pandas and NumPy open up a lot of possibilities, even for small projects.</li>
                    <li>Java’s structure is useful, but Python fits my style better for now as I’m just starting out.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I also learned that Python’s flexibility makes it easier to experiment. I could try out ideas for
                    scripts or data projects without worrying about complex setups, which made coding feel less
                    intimidating.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="conclusion">
                <h2>Final Thoughts on My Shift to Python</h2>
                <p>Switching to Python over Java is really a game-changer for me, and I owe a lot of that to Zia
                    Sir. His classes made Python feel approachable and fun, and its simplicity and tools like Pandas and
                    NumPy let me build stuff quickly. It’s not that Java’s bad but it’s just that Python fits where I’m
                    at
                    as a student. I’m looking forward to working on more projects and sharing what I’m learning here.
