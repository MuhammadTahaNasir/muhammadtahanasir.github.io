                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>It’s March 2022, and I’m a 12th grader trying to figure out what to study in uninversity and later
                    persuing my career. I’ve been hearing a lot about Artificial Intelligence with things like
                    self-driving cars and chatbots, but I’m also looking at Computer Science. After thinking it over, I
                    decided to go with CS. This post is about why I made that choice and what went into it.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="why-cs">
                <h2>Why I Picked CS</h2>
                <p>Computer Science feels like a solid starting point. It teaches you the basics, like algorithms,
                    coding in languages like C or Java, and how systems work. AI sounds interesting, but it seems like
                    you need to know a lot already to get into it. CS gives me a foundation I can build on, and I can
                    always learn AI later if I want.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strong base: CS skills like coding and problem-solving seem useful everywhere.</li>
                    <li>Options: I can explore AI or other fields after learning the fundamentals.</li>
                    <li>Control: Writing code in C or Java feels straightforward compared to AI’s complexity.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="how-i-decided">
                <h2>How I Made My Choice</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>I spent time reading online. AI was all over the news, but CS seemed to be the backbone of
                        everything, from apps to websites.</li>
                    <li>I tried coding a bit in Python and Java. CS felt more approachable, while AI seemed tough to
                        start without a lot of prep.</li>
                    <li>I thought about my future. I want a career where I can try different things, and CS seemed to
                        give me more paths to choose from.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section id="what-i-learned">
                <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>CS applies to a lot of areas, like games, apps, or even healthcare, not just one thing like AI.
                    </li>
                    <li>AI felt like a big jump for someone just starting out. CS gives me a way to ease into things.
                    </li>
                    <li>A senior I talked to said AI jobs often ask for experience. CS skills are easier to start with
                        as a beginner.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I also found that CS fits how I like to learn. There are tons of free coding tutorials online, which
                    makes it easier to get started. AI resources were harder to find and understand, so CS
                    felt like the better choice for now.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="things-i-considered">
                <h2>Things I Considered</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Resources: There are plenty of CS tutorials and books out there, more than what I found for AI ,
                        internet still needs more information about it, which I cant find currently.</li>
                    <li>Future plans: With CS, I can pick up AI later once I have the basics down.</li>
                    <li>My pace: CS lets me learn step by step without feeling rushed into one specific field.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I also noticed job postings often asked for basic coding skills, which CS covers. AI jobs seemed to
                    want more experience than I have right now, so CS made more sense to start with.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="conclusion">
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Choosing CS over AI in today is about building a strong foundation and keeping my options open.
                    It feels like the right step for me as a student just starting out. I’m looking forward to learning
                    more and sharing my journey here. This is my first post, and I’ll keep writing as I go!</p>
